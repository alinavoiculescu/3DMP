# WINDUP MOTOR CAR



# What is a windup toy? 

A windup toy is an automaton toy powered by a clockwork motor. 



# What is clockwork? 

Clockwork means, literally, "working like a clock" (an old-fashioned clock, that you wind with a key). A clockwork device is completely mechanical and has these essential parts: 

	• A key (or crown) you wind to add energy. 

	• A spiral spring to store the energy you add with the key. (Pendulum clocks store energy with weights that rise and fall, but other clocks and windup wristwatches use springs instead.) 

	• A set of gears through which the spring's energy is released. The gears control how quickly (or slowly) a clockwork machine can do things, but they also control how much force it can produce (for climbing inclines, perhaps). 

	• A mechanism the gears drive that makes the device do useful or interesting things. In a clock, the mechanism is the set of hands that sweep around the dial to tell you the time. In a clockwork car, the gears would drive the wheels that power it over your floor.


# How does a clockwork toy work?

This is how a clockwork toy works:
If you wind up a clockwork car as much as you can, then let the key go, without putting the car on the ground, you'll hear the gears inside the mechanism screech and squeal as the spring releases its energy amazingly quickly. Since there's very little resistance except friction (the rubbing force between touching surfaces) in the gearbox, there's nothing really for the mechanism to work against and it can deliver energy very fast. Put it on a rug and the energy is delivered much more slowly (and quietly). Now the spring has to work against the resistance of the fabric, which works like a brake on the wheels and the gears that power them.
